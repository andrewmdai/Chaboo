# Chaboo
Chaboo is a game of Charades with TABOO movements!
Each card will show a clue you will need to act out, with certain actions that you aren't allowed to act out. Be creative and try to get your team to guess the clue!
If your team guesses the correct answer, swipe to the right! If the clue is too difficult to act out, swipe left to skip.
